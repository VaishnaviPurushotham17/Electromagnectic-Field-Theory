# Electromagnetic Field Theory – Physical Visualization using Python

## Overview

This repository contains Python-based simulations and physical visualizations of fundamental concepts from **Electromagnetic Field Theory (EMFT)**.

The objective of this project is to transform mathematical electromagnetic equations into clear physical intuition through computational modeling and animations.

Instead of only solving equations on paper, this repository demonstrates how electromagnetic fields actually behave in space and time.

## Objectives

- Visualize electromagnetic wave propagation in 2D and 3D
- Demonstrate orthogonality of **E, H, and k vectors**
- Simulate different types of polarization
- Model anisotropic media using permittivity tensors
- Improve conceptual clarity of Maxwell’s equations
- Bridge theory with computational physics

## Why This Repository is Important

Electromagnetic Field Theory is mathematically intensive.  
This repository converts:

- Differential equations → Visual animations  
- Vector calculus → Physical understanding  
- Tensor mathematics → Observable field behavior  

It helps in:

- Antenna design intuition  
- RF propagation understanding  
- Advanced EM research preparation
